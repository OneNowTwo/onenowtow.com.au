You are working on my existing website codebase for onenowtwo.com.au (currently positioned as wedding videography). I need you to pivot the entire site to “Property Video Production” (commercial + residential, Sydney/NSW). Keep the current tech stack and deployment setup exactly the same, only change content, structure, and media.

GOALS
- Rebrand from weddings to property-focused video production.
- Use my existing styling/components where possible (minimal refactor).
- Add a Portfolio page/section that showcases my property videos.
- Update all copy, headings, CTAs, navigation, metadata, and forms to match property.
- Remove/replace any wedding language across the whole codebase.

SITE STRUCTURE (must implement)
Nav:
- Home
- Services
- Portfolio
- About
- Enquire (or Contact)

HOME PAGE (new hero + sections)
Hero:
- Headline: “Property videos that sell the story — and the square metres.”
- Subheadline: “Cinematic walkthroughs, agent-led socials, drone, and edit packages for developers, agents, and vendors.”
- Primary CTA button: “Get a quote”
- Secondary CTA: “View portfolio”

Sections:
1) Social proof / outcomes (short): “Faster interest. Cleaner listings. Better brand.”
2) Services overview cards (link to Services page)
3) Portfolio teaser (3–6 videos)
4) Process: Shoot → Edit → Deliver (fast turnarounds)
5) Contact CTA strip

SERVICES PAGE
Create service blocks with concise copy:
- Listing Walkthrough Video (30–90s)
- Social Cuts / Reels Package (vertical + captions)
- Drone / Aerials (if available)
- Agent Piece-to-Camera (optional)
- Development / Commercial Property Films
- Photography add-on (ONLY if I already offer it; otherwise omit)

Each service: what it includes + typical turnaround + “Enquire” CTA.

PORTFOLIO PAGE
I will provide video files or links. Build a simple responsive grid:
- Each item shows thumbnail + title + location + short description.
- Clicking opens modal/lightbox or dedicated page and plays video.
- If files are local, store them in /public/videos (or equivalent) and reference properly.
- If hosted (YouTube/Vimeo), embed with responsive aspect ratio.

ABOUT PAGE
Rewrite about copy for property:
- I’m Michael, cinematographer/director/producer with 15+ years experience.
- Based Sydney/NSW. Fast, organised, easy handover.
- Tools: Premiere Pro, After Effects (light titles), Resolve (basic colour).
- I use AI thoughtfully for mood boards, fast concepts, and post graphics support (not gimmicky).

ENQUIRE / CONTACT
- Update the form fields to property specific:
  - Name, Email, Phone
  - Property address/suburb
  - Type: Residential / Commercial / Development
  - Agent/Vendor/Developer
  - What you need: Walkthrough / Reels / Drone / Other
  - Preferred shoot date
  - Message
- Make sure form submission still works exactly as it did before.

GLOBAL REBRAND REQUIREMENTS
- Replace all mentions of “wedding”, “bride”, “groom”, etc everywhere.
- Update site title, meta description, OpenGraph tags, and favicon/title if needed.
  - Site title: “One Now Two | Property Video Production”
  - Meta description: “Sydney property videos: walkthroughs, reels, drone & commercial films.”
- Update homepage imagery to property-relevant visuals (use placeholders if you need until I add my media).
- Make sure URLs remain clean (avoid breaking existing routes). If there are wedding routes, redirect them to relevant new pages.

MEDIA INTEGRATION
Ask me where the videos are located:
- If I have local MP4 files: implement using HTML5 <video> with controls off by default + hover play optional.
- If I have links: implement embeds.

DELIVERABLE
- Commit changes so the whole site is property-focused.
- Provide me a short checklist of what you changed and where to add/replace portfolio videos (exact folder paths + file naming).
