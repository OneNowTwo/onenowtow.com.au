Great question. Because your site is a custom React app on Replit (static deploy), you should choose “JavaScript tag” (not WordPress, not tracking pixel). Here’s exactly how to hook it up:

Do this

In the tool’s modal (the one in your screenshot), click JavaScript tag → Select.

It will show you a small <script> snippet. Copy it.

In your Replit project, open:
public/index.html (same file where your <title> and <meta> live).

Paste the snippet just before the closing </head> tag. Example:

<!-- other meta & links above -->
<script>
  /* your platform's JS snippet goes here */
</script>
</head>


If it gives you a <script src="...">, use that as-is. If it supports async/defer, keep them.

Save → Deploy Latest in Replit.

Verify it’s working

Open your live site, then the platform’s dashboard → it should show the site as connected/receiving hits.

Optional: in your browser dev tools → Network tab, refresh the page and confirm the tracking script loads (you’ll see a request to their domain).

Notes (so it keeps tracking correctly)

If you use React Router (multiple sections without page reloads), most trackers need a manual page-view on route changes. You can add:

import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useLocation } from "react-router-dom";

export function useTrackPageViews() {
  const { pathname } = useLocation();
  useEffect(() => {
    if (window.myTracker && window.myTracker.page) {
      window.myTracker.page(pathname); // replace with your tool’s pageview call
    }
  }, [pathname]);
}


Then call useTrackPageViews() in your main layout.

If you later add Google Tag Manager to juggle GA4, Meta Pixel, TikTok Pixel, etc., paste GTM the same way (before </head>) and let GTM inject the rest—keeps your code clean.

Common gotchas

HTTPS/Mixed content: your site is HTTPS; the script must load over HTTPS too.

Cache: if you don’t see it firing, hard refresh or add ?v=2 to your site URL to bypass cache.

Content Security Policy: you’re not setting one right now, so you’re fine. If you add a CSP later, whitelist the tracker’s domain.
