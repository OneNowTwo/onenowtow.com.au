Got it — your form is functionally working now (submits to Formspree → redirects to /thanks → fires Google Ads conversion), but the thank-you page looks ugly and off-brand. Let’s fix this properly so it matches your dark, elegant One Now Two brand.

Step 1 — Update your /thanks page content

Instead of that default ugly box, let’s give you something that feels classy and consistent with your site. Replace the content of your client/src/pages/thanks.tsx with this:

import React from "react";

export default function Thanks() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-center bg-black text-white px-6">
      <div className="max-w-xl text-center">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-light mb-4">Thank You</h1>
        <p className="text-lg mb-8 text-gray-300">
          We’ve received your enquiry. Our team will be in touch soon to talk
          about your wedding plans.
        </p>
        <a
          href="/"
          className="inline-block bg-white text-black px-6 py-3 rounded-full hover:bg-gray-200 transition"
        >
          Back to Home
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


✅ This uses your dark theme with clean typography and spacing.
✅ The “Back to Home” button matches your minimalist style.
✅ Mobile responsive by default (Tailwind utility classes).

Step 2 — Keep conversion tracking clean

At the top of this component (after imports), you’ll still need the Google Ads event trigger:

import { useEffect } from "react";

export default function Thanks() {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (typeof window !== "undefined" && (window as any).gtag) {
      (window as any).gtag("event", "conversion", {
        send_to: "AW-17589875168/YOUR_CONVERSION_LABEL",
      });
    }
  }, []);


👉 Replace YOUR_CONVERSION_LABEL with the actual one Google gave you (e.g., AW-17589875168/abc123xyz).
👉 This fires only on the thanks page — so your conversions stay accurate.

Step 3 — Remove the ugly “form submitted” message

That ugly box you saw (“Thanks! The form was submitted successfully.”) was Formspree’s default success page. By adding the _redirect hidden input (which we did), you skip their page entirely and land straight on your styled /thanks page. That’s what you want.

Step 4 — Test end-to-end

Fill out the form on /enquire.

Submit → it should redirect cleanly to your new branded /thanks.

Open Google Tag Assistant (Chrome extension) or Google Ads → check that the conversion event fired.
